# Emil

A pascal compiler, named after the legend Niklaus Emil Wirth.

# Plans

* Will probably adhere to the [informal Pascal standard](http://pascal.hansotten.com/uploads/standardpascal/Standard%20PASCAL.pdf) to begin with.
* Will likely use cranelift for codegen.
* May incorporate features from Extended Pascal, FreePascal etc.
* May shift to a Modula-2 implementation.
